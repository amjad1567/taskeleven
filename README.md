# Task Nine: Image Hover Effect

This repository contains two approaches to implement an image hover effect where the image disappears when the mouse hovers over it and reappears when the mouse is not in the area.

## Files:
1. **index.html** - JavaScript-only implementation.
2. **index1.html** - CSS-only implementation.

## Instructions

### JavaScript-Only Approach:
- The file `index.html` uses JavaScript to hide and show the image on hover.
- It listens for the `onmouseover` and `onmouseout` events and modifies the image's `display` property.

### CSS-Only Approach:
- The file `index_css.html` uses pure CSS to achieve the same effect.
- The `:hover` pseudo-class hides the image when hovered over and restores it when the mouse leaves.

## How to Test:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open either of the HTML files in a browser.
3. Hover over the image to see the effect.
